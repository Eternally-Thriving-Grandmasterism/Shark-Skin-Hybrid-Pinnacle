## Shark Skin Hybrid Applications Lattice

1. Shark + Lotus: Ribbed superhydrophobic hulls → ships, Cybertruck (drag reduction + self-cleaning)
   Benefit: Lower fuel/energy, no biocides

2. Shark + Moth-Eye: AR riblets → solar panels, Starship optics (light harvest + clean)
   Advantage: Efficiency retained in dust/humidity

3. Shark + Crocodile: Armored low-drag panels → Optimus exoskeleton, rover wheels
   Advantage: Impact resistance + reduced rolling drag

4. Shark + Butterfly: Iridescent ribbed surfaces → Powrush™ skins, Tesla wraps
   Application: Dynamic beauty + aero performance

5. Shark + Petal: Pinned low-drag condensers → battery cooling, cryogenics
   Advantage: Controlled moisture without loss
