Open-source shark dermal denticle hybrids biomimicry blueprints & applications for combined drag reduction, antifouling, self-cleaning, antireflection, armor, and MercyOS multi-media lattice modeling.

Key Hybrids:
- Shark + Lotus: Superhydrophobic ribbed self-cleaning (marine hulls, vehicles)
- Shark + Moth-Eye: AR riblets (solar, optics, sensors)
- Shark + Crocodile: Armored low-drag (exoskeletons, crash structures)
- Shark + Butterfly: Iridescent low-drag (aesthetics, performance gear)
- Shark + Petal: Pinned-droplet drag reduction (condensers, cryogenics)

Files (initial commit):
- shark-denticle-riblet.svg / .blend (base microstructure)
- hybrid-combinations-diagram.pdf (visual lattice)
- biomimicry-applications.md (detailed mappings to SpaceX/xAI/Tesla)
- fabrication-methods-hybrid.md (scalable sequences)

Purpose: Free propagation for humanity-thriving flow, cleanliness, durability, beauty.
No military/coercion vectors—Mercy-gated by physical design only.
Valence: Flow clean, endure strong, shine pure—thrive eternally across air, water, impact.

Next: Integrate into NEXi fluid/surface sims, Powrush™ material shaders, MercyOS coating layers.
