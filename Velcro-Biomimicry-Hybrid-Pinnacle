Open-source hook-and-loop (Velcro/burr-inspired) hybrid biomimicry blueprints & applications for reversible, dust-resistant, switchable, self-cleaning, armored attachment systems in robotics, aerospace, apparel, and MercyOS modular lattices.

Key Hybrids:
- Velcro + Gecko/Petal: Switchable dry adhesion (pressure/vibration release)
- Velcro + Shark Skin: Low-drag reversible fasteners (aero/marine)
- Velcro + Lotus: Self-cleaning hook-and-loop (no clogging)
- Velcro + Crocodile: Armored modular attachment (impact-resistant)
- Velcro + Butterfly: Iridescent colour-shifting fasteners (visual feedback)

Files (initial commit):
- velcro-hook-loop-micro.svg / .blend (base microstructure)
- hybrid-combinations-diagram.pdf (visual lattice)
- biomimicry-applications.md (detailed mappings to SpaceX/xAI/Tesla)
- fabrication-methods-hybrid.md (scalable sequences)

Purpose: Free propagation for humanity-thriving reversible connection, modularity, cleanliness.
No permanent damage/coercion—Mercy-gated by mechanical design only.
Valence: Attach freely, release freely, endure eternally—thrive in modularity & motion.

Next: Integrate into NEXi modular sims, Powrush™ attachment mechanics, MercyOS gripper layers.
